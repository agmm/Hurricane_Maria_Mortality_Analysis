# Takeaways

---
class: left

### Which municipalities in PR should prioritize their emergency response plan revision to prevent fatalities in case of future natural disasters?

#### Conclusions

* We observe a cluster of municipalities with high mortality rates in the mountainous/central region of the main Island. 

* Most of the municipalities that are on the west coast ranked in the lowest 20% of the mortality rates. This might be explained by the fact that the trajectory of the hurricane crossed thorugh the north-east and center part of the main Island

#### Limitations

* Time distribution of the individual fatalities
* Previous year municipality-level mortality data
* Even inside a same municipality there can be huge differences in mortality rates between different sectors or neighborhoods.

### Which type of municipal zone, urban or rural, had higher mortality rates?

#### Conclusions

* On average, for every 1,000 persons, 4 persons died in rural zones and 2 persons in urban zones.

* The urban area of San Juan, which has the best health infrastructure, was the overall zone with the highest mortality rate in Puerto Rico.

#### Limitations

* Age structure of the municipalities
* Income distribution per municipality
* The definitions of municipal zones are assessed by the Department of Health but the guidelines are not easily available to corroborate the data.
